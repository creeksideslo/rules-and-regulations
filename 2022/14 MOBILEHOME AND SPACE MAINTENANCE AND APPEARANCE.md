reasonable fee for services relating to the maintenance of the land and premises

written notice will state the specific condition to be corrected and an estimate of the
charges to be imposed by Owner if the services are performed by Owner or its
agents.

customer service and contact information is provided to Homeowner by the
provider. All trash must be kept in Creekside-approved receptacles and in a
