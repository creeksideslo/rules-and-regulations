# 6. USE OF SPACE
A. No Commercial Activity: The mobilehome and Space shall be used only for private
residential purposes and no business or commercial activity of any nature shall be
conducted thereon, except for home occupation businesses that are properly
licensed by the City of San Luis Obispo ("City"), have met all City requirements, and
have obtained prior written approval from management. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the following business and commercial activities are prohibited:

1. Sharing residency of any Space through a referral service (whether commercial
or nonprofit), including, but not limited to, any website such as Airbnb, Vacation
Rentals by Owner (VRBO), etc.

2. Any activity inconsistent with lawful and enforceable Creekside zoning and any
conditional use permits, which would increase the risk of harm to Owner or to
any other person or property.

3. Any activity which increases insurance costs to Owner or Homeowner or affects
the ability of either or both to obtain insurance.

4. Any activity which would increase noise, dust, vibration, odors or fumes, smoke
or any other condition offensive to the senses, traffic (vehicle or pedestrian),
congestion, deliveries and delivery or mail trucks, require storage of anything
outside of the mobilehome, result in manufacturing of anything, require
employees or other persons on the Space or affect parking.

B. Mobilehome Occupancy by Registered Owner: At all times, at least one (1)
Homeowner must regularly reside in and be the registered owner on title to the
mobilehome that occupies the Space. The registered owner of the mobilehome must
apply and qualify for tenancy and must occupy the mobilehome upon acceptance to
reside at the Space. Each application for residency is based solely upon the
applicant's qualifications; guarantors are not accepted. Each applicant for residency
must represent, in writing, to Creekside that the Space is, and will be, the applicant's
permanent and primary place of residency, and that no other person will reside in
the mobilehome on the Space without the applicant's presence, regardless of
whether such person has been listed on the application or Lease Agreement as an
Additional Occupant.
