# 8. ADDITIONAL OCCUPANTS
A. Additional Occupants and Guests: Guests must register with Owner if they stay
with Homeowner more than twenty (20) consecutive days or thirty (30) days in a
calendar year. With the exception of a companion, live-in caregiver or family
member, as set forth in Civil Code Sections 798.34 and 798.35, if any guest stays
beyond the foregoing period, Homeowner will be charged a reasonable Additional
Occupant fee, as set forth in the Lease Agreement, for each day following the
expiration of such period. For emergency reasons, Homeowner should register any
overnight guest with management.

Homeowner agrees to acquaint all Additional Occupants and guests with the
the conditions of tenancy at Creekside, including, but not limited to, these Rules.
Additional Occupants and guests shall have no rights of tenancy in Creekside, and
any agreement between Homeowner and Homeowner's Additional Occupants will
not change the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement between Owner and
Homeowner.

A. violation of these Rules by an Additional Occupant or guest shall be deemed a
violation of these Rules by Homeowner, and Homeowner's tenancy shall be subject
to termination as a result thereof pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.56(d).

B. Companions: A Homeowner who is living alone in a mobilehome and who wishes
to share occupancy of the mobilehome with one (1) other person, to be designated
as the Homeowner's companion, may do so. A Homeowner may only designate one
(1) person at a time as a companion and shall not designate more than three (3) 
companions during any calendar year, unless authorized by management.

C. Live-in Caregivers: Homeowner may share his or her mobilehome with any person
over eighteen (18) years of age, if that person is providing live-in health care, live-in
supportive care, or supervision to Homeowner. Management may require written
confirmation from a licensed health care professional of Homeowner's need for the
care or supervision, as provided in Civil Code Section 798.34(c).

D. Responsibility of Homeowner: Homeowners are personally and fully legally liable
and responsible for all the actions and conduct of their Additional Occupants and
guests while in any location within Creekside, as though the actions and conduct
were Homeowner's. Homeowner releases and agrees to indemnify and provide a
defense to Owner from and against any and all liability resulting from, in whole or in
part, the presence of an Additional Occupant or guest while on or near Creekside
property.
