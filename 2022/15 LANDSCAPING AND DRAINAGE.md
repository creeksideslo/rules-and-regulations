# 15. LANDSCAPING AND DRAINAGE
A. Maintenance: Each Homeowner shall landscape his or her Space in a clean,
attractive, and well-kept fashion. Lawns must be regularly mowed, trimmed, and
watered with all weeds and debris removed weekly. Vegetation must not rub
against any mobilehome or other structure or interfere with property belonging to
others. Trees and shrubbery must not obscure the open view of Creekside streets.
Homeowner is responsible for arranging for someone to maintain the Space and
landscaping while Homeowner is absent. If Homeowner's property or actions
(digging, postholes, etc.) damage Creekside improvements (carport or street
asphalt, curbs, gutters, utilities, streetlights, etc.), Homeowner will be responsible
for their repair or replacement. The street and gutters in front of the Space shall be
kept clean, neat, and free of dirt and standing water. Water from sprinklers or hoses
is not allowed to excessively wet the streets or flood the gutters. Timer-controlled
automatic sprinklers shall be adjusted seasonally to prevent over-watering during
cooler and/or wetter months.

B. Prior Written Approval: No landscape installations or changes shall be undertaken
without management's prior written approval. Landscaping of Spaces or changes to
existing landscape shall be completed within forty-five (45) days of the date of
management's approval of the installations or changes. Prior to commencing any
landscaping work, including changes to existing landscape, changes to, additions to,
or deletions of any fence, carport, awning, cabana or any structure of any kind,
Homeowner shall submit a detailed landscape plan to Creekside for approval.
Because of the infinite variety of living and non-living objects which may be used in
landscaping, it is impossible to describe all things Creekside will or will not accept
as landscaping. Consequently, the following general landscape standards are
provided only to assist Homeowner in preliminary planning. Any changes to
existing landscaping made without management's prior written approval must be
returned to their original state upon notice from Owner.

C. General Standards: Except for the use of Creekside-approved artificial turf, only
live plants may be used. Evergreen grasses, ground cover, flowers and small shrubs
om are generally acceptable. Plant material known to have control problems, including,
but not limited to, bamboo, is not permitted. Lawns must be mowed and trimmed,
and all landscaping must be kept clean and attractive in appearance. With
management's prior written approval, small decorative rock not dyed or artificially
colored or exceeding 3/4 inch in size is allowed as ground cover, if utilized with 
fabric or plastic underlayment designed for landscaping and not covering more than
twenty-five (25) percent of the Space. Pea gravel is not permitted. If decorative
small rock is used, additional rock must be added as necessary to ensure that there
are sufficient quantities to fully cover the underlayment. Bark, wood chips and
mulch are not permitted, except with prior written approval from management.
While potted plants are permitted, all such plants must be attractive, planted in
attractive plastic or ceramic pots, trimmed, watered, and maintained as necessary
and must not detract from the overall appearance of the Space. Owner reserves the
right to restrict the number of potted plants to no more than ten (10) pots per
Space.

D. Drainage: Homeowner is responsible for ensuring that the drainage on the Space is
correct so water will drain away from the Space and discharge onto the roadway
and not onto other Spaces or Common Areas. This may include re-grading the Space
if the present grade does not meet these requirements. No one may alter the existing
drainage or grading of the Space or the park without management's prior written
approval. All watering systems shall be installed, maintained, and adjusted as
necessary to avoid water run-off and standing water. Any berms shall be maintained
to avoid the accumulation of water on the Space. Washing of streets and driveways
is not permitted. Car washing is permitted only in the designated car wash area.
E. Vegetable Gardens: Small, low-growing vegetable gardens are permissible in the
rear portion of the Space, provided that they are neat, clean, and well cared for at all
times.

E. Trees: Homeowner is responsible for routine tree maintenance, including pruning,
trimming and removal, and Homeowner's failure to perform such maintenance
entitles Creekside to take corrective action and Homeowner shall reimburse
Creekside for such maintenance. Homeowner must obtain written permission from
Creekside to plant a tree on the Space. Creekside retains the option to determine the
location and type of tree which may be planted. Large plants and trees may not be
planted by any street, driveway, walkway, patio, or other improvement made of
asphalt or concrete that might be cracked by roots. No tree or shrubbery is allowed
which has, or may develop, a root structure which causes cracking, buckling or
otherwise interferes with streets, driveways, or other Creekside facilities.
Except as provided in the MRL, Homeowner is solely responsible for the trimming,
pruning and removal of any tree, and the cost thereof, located on Homeowner's
Space.

G. Notification of Hazards: Homeowner has an obligation to notify Creekside of any
danger, hazard or health and safety violation on Homeowner's Space.
