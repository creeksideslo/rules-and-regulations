cat, one (1) small dog (no more than fifty (50) pounds at full maturity), one (1)
aquatic animal kept in an aquarium, or one (1) other animal with prior written

which may be more numerous, Homeowner may keep two (2) pets at the Space.
Homeowner must register such pets with Creekside and sign a Pet Agreement.
Owner reserves the right to deny Homeowner a pet if the proposed pet appears to
present a threat to the health and safety or general welfare of Creekside or its
Homeowners. Pets permitted in Creekside are house pets that spend their primary
existence within the mobilehome. Birds must be kept within the mobilehome and
must be restricted to the types of birds generally kept as house pets such as
parakeets, canaries, finches, or parrots. Should Homeowner lose his or her pet, or
should it die, Homeowner must register any new pet with Owner.

C. Prohibited Pets: Aggressive breed dogs, including, but not limited to, Pit Bull
Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, Dobermans, Chow Chows, Rottweilers, German
Shepherds, Akitas, Mastiffs, Cane Corsos, Alaskan Malamutes, Presa Canarios and
Wolf Hybrids, are strictly prohibited. Guide dogs, signal dogs and other service dogs,
as defined by Civil Code Section 54.1, are exempt from the breed restrictions
otherwise applicable to dogs.

1. Non-house pets are prohibited under any circumstances. Strange and exotic pets
are not permitted. Farm animals (chickens, etc.) are strictly prohibited.

D. Rules Applicable to All Pet Owners:
1. Each household is permitted to have two (2) pets while residing in Creekside, so
long as these Rules regarding pets, and the Pet Agreement, are strictly complied
with.

2. Homeowner must notify management before any pet is brought into Creekside
and must fill out and execute a Pet Agreement and submit a recent photograph
of the pet(s). The pet(s) may not be brought into Creekside until the pet(s) and
the Pet Agreement are approved by management.

3. Homeowners are responsible for updating the information submitted to
management regarding their pet(s), including, but not limited to, informing
management of the loss or death of a pet.

4. All pets must be licensed and inoculated (where applicable) in accordance with
local and state laws. Evidence of such licensure and inoculation must be
submitted by Homeowner to management within seven (7) days after request by
management.

5. Each pet must be contained within the enclosed area of its owner's Space and
shall not, at any time, be loose anywhere in Creekside. A loose pet with proper
identification, i.e., tags, that escapes from its owner's Space will be returned to its
owner. Three (3) such escapes shall result in the termination of the Pet
Agreement as to that pet and expulsion of that pet from Creekside within ten
(10) days of notice of such termination. A loose pet without proper identification
that escapes from its owner's Space will be removed from Creekside by Animal
Control.

6. Homeowner is solely responsible for maintaining any area where a pet is kept.
Clean up and disposal of pet excrement and other pet waste is Homeowner's 
responsibility, and such excrement and waste must be immediately cleaned up

Rules.

7. All pets must be fed inside of the mobilehome. Outdoor feeding of dogs, cats, and
birds, including any stray or wild animals, is strictly prohibited.

absolute discretion, determine whether, for purposes of these Rules and the Pet
Agreement, a particular animal is or is not a domestic pet and/or whether the
number of such animals kept and maintained, or proposed to be kept and
maintained, is reasonable.
