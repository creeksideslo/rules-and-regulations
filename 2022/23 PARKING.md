# 23. PARKING
A. Parking Generally: Parking of Homeowner's vehicles is permitted only on
Homeowner's Space and such vehicles may only be parked on the driveway, not on
landscaped or other areas of the Space. All driveways must maintain room for the
parking of no less than two (2) full-sized vehicles at all times, even if such vehicles
are not parked there at all times. Temporary street parking is allowed only between
the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Vehicles belonging to repairmen, delivery
persons, health care personnel or park personnel may be parked for short periods of 
time on the street immediately adjoining the Space where service is being
provided. Vehicles parked in Homeowner's driveway shall not protrude into the
street.

B. Guest Parking: Guest vehicles may be parked in areas of Creekside designated as
"Guest Parking." Homeowner shall not park in Guest Parking without prior written
approval from management, which approval may be withheld as management sees
fit. The use of Guest Parking shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours at a time. No
Homeowner, Additional Occupant or guest may park in any area designated as a fire
lane.

C. Overnight Parking and Storage: No vehicle may be parked overnight on any
Creekside street. Vehicles may not be parked on empty Spaces. No vehicle may be
"stored" on Homeowner's Space, and all vehicles must be regularly used for
transportation. "Storage" shall include, but is not limited to, parking of any
inoperative vehicle for a period exceeding two (2) weeks, parking of an operative
vehicle that is not used for a period exceeding four (4) weeks, or parking more than
one (1) vehicle for the purpose of selling such vehicles as part of a commercial
activity.

D. Permitted Vehicles: Only automobiles, pickup trucks rated 34 ton or less,
motorcycles and campers attached to pickup trucks that can be accommodated

Spaces, are not permitted.

E. Liability: Creekside is not liable for any damage to vehicles, including damage due
to collision, malicious mischief, theft, vandalism, or any cause whatsoever, parked in
Creekside. Improperly parked vehicles may be towed at the owner's expense in
accordance with applicable local and state towing ordinances and statutes. Vehicles
parked in any Guest Parking which remain in the same space for ninety-six (96)
hours will be presumed to be stored and may be towed, unless other arrangements
are made with management, in advance and in writing. Homeowner hereby gives
Creekside express permission to tow any vehicle which is illegally parked or stored,
either on the Space or anywhere in Creekside. Homeowner specifically waives any
injury or damage to the vehicle while it is being towed.

E. R.V. Parking: R.V. parking is not permitted in Creekside, with the exception of
parking in Homeowner's driveway for loading or unloading for up to twelve (12)
