See Exhibit 1 hereto, incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

CREEKSIDE COMMUNITY
EXHIBIT "1"
ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS


A. Prior Written Approval: Homeowner may not install Homeowner's mobilehome or its
accessory structures or equipment, make any alterations, improvements, additions or
utility installations to, on or about the Space or mobilehome, install, remove or change
any existing improvements, modify the drainage or landscaping on Homeowner's Space,
or make any contract for such work, without prior written approval from management
to ensure compliance with these Rules, Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations
("Title 25") and all other applicable laws.

B. Proposal for Work, Alterations and Additions: Prior to the commencement and
contracting for work to be performed on the mobilehome, accessory structures or
equipment, including the exterior of the mobilehome (including painting), Homeowner
must: (1) submit to management a Space Improvement Approval Form; (2) submit to
management a true and correct copy of a valid and current state contractor's license for
the contractor performing the work; and (3) submit to management proof of liability
and workers compensation insurance, as applicable, for the contractor performing the
work.

C. Timing of Installation and Completion of Improvements: With the exception of the
installation of the mobilehome, the installation of all required items, including, but not
limited to, awnings, porches, carports, storage cabinets and landscaping, must be
completed within sixty (60) days after installation of the mobilehome, unless
Homeowner obtains prior written approval from management.

D. General Standards: Because of the wide variety of mobilehomes and other
improvements, it is impossible to describe all improvements that are acceptable at
Creekside. Consequently, park standards are listed only to assist Homeowner in
preliminary planning. Homeowner is cautioned that there are Spaces in Creekside that
do not conform to current park standards; therefore, do not assume that Homeowner's
plans will be approved because they are similar to other Spaces.

Homeowner must maintain the Space and other improvements in good condition and
repair, including replacement of any items which are missing or damaged. Standards
which were previously applicable to Homeowner's Space and other improvements will
remain applicable until Homeowner replaces, modifies, improves, repairs, or replaces
the mobilehome or improvement. At the time Homeowner constructs, remodels, or
repairs the mobilehome or improvement, Homeowner is obligated to adhere to current
park standards.

E. Mobilehome Placement and Installation: Homeowner's mobilehome must be placed
as far as possible to the rear of the Space to allow for the maximum setback from the
street, and as low as possible to the ground. Homeowner must install a water system
pressure regulator on Homeowner's side of the utility system, and Homeowner must
maintain the regulator. The mobilehome must be installed in such a way as to ensure
proper grading and drainage, in keeping with applicable laws and the additional
drainage and material wash-off restrictions imposed due to the presence of a protected
creek/estuary on Creekside property. Homeowner must install gravel and/or a
moisture barrier under the mobilehome, and the mobilehome may only be painted
colors approved in advance and in writing by management.

F. Steps/Decks/Landings/Porches/Ramps: Steps, decks, landings, porches and/or ramps 
with sturdy handrails are required for each exterior door of the mobilehome. All
improvements must be in accordance with all laws and regulations, with building
permits and management's prior written approval obtained for each project.

Construction must be in a "workmanlike" manner that is aesthetically compatible with
the mobilehome, and improvements must be constructed from materials that have been
approved in advance and in writing by management. Walking surfaces shall be covered
with stained hardwood, redwood, composite decking, indoor/outdoor carpeting, or
other materials approved in advance and in writing by management. No animal
enclosures, accordion-type folding gates, wire screens or mesh are permitted on steps
or decks, and lattice on porches and carports is not permitted. Each mobilehome, where
possible, will be required to have two (2) (front and rear) doors with landings and
approved railings around any porches, platforms, or stairs more than thirty (30) inches
high.

G. Skirting: Skirting is required and must be constructed of the same material as the
exterior siding of the mobilehome, or another park-approved material. Skirting shall
securely surround the entire mobilehome to prevent animals from entering while
allowing adequate cross ventilation. Any damaged skirting must be repaired within
seven (7) days upon receipt of notice from management. If a skirting material is no
longer available, Homeowner must submit to management, in writing, a Space
Improvement Approval Form to obtain approval for installation of another material.

H. Rain Gutters and Downspouts: All mobilehomes must be fitted with rain gutters and
downspouts which extend to the ground and drain water to the street.

I. Carports and Awnings: Carports and awnings are required and must be a minimum of
ten feet (10') wide by forty feet (40') long, with exceptions for unique Space limitations.
Awnings must be attached in compliance with all local and state codes and regulations.
Awnings, awning columns/supports, and downspouts must be manufactured and
vertically plumbed and specifically engineered for local weather conditions and wind.
Runoff water shall be directed into the street gutters. Structurally damaged awning
columns/supports shall be repaired immediately. Individual awnings ("eyebrow
awnings") may be installed over windows if the awnings are aesthetically compatible
with the mobilehome and other awnings on the Space and if Homeowner obtains prior
written approval from management. No lattice, corrugated fiberglass or metal, canvas,
cloth, screen, or roll-up type units are permitted to be installed on the stanchions.

J. Storage Cabinets: A storage cabinet may be located on the Space, so long as: (1) the
required exits and openings for light and ventilation of the mobilehome, cabana or
building component are not obstructed; (2) the location does not prevent service or
inspection of the mobilehome or Space's equipment or utility connections; (3) the
separation requirements from structures on adjacent Spaces is maintained; and (4) the
storage cabinet is located on the rear half of the Space, with exceptions for unique Space
limitations.
Storage cabinets must not exceed ten feet (10') in height from the foundation to the
highest peak. The total, combined floor area of all storage cabinets on a Space shall not
exceed one hundred twenty (120) square feet. Homeowner may have a maximum of
two (2) storage cabinets on a Space. Any utilities installed must have appropriate 
building permits. Shingle roofs, hardboard siding and colors shall be compatible with
the appearance of the mobilehome.

K. Cabana: One (1) cabana, as defined in Title 25, is permitted to be placed on certain
Spaces only, and will be approved on a case-by-case basis, in the sole discretion of
management. All applicable permits must be obtained in advance. The cabana must be
designed and constructed as a freestanding structure and must comply with all local
and state rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, Title 25.

L. Ramada: One (1) ramada, as defined in Title 25, is permitted to be placed on certain
Spaces only, and will be approved on a case-by-case basis, in the sole discretion of
management. All applicable permits must be obtained in advance. The ramada must be
designed and constructed as a freestanding, self-supporting structure meeting the
structural requirements of Title 25. A ramada shall not be enclosed or partially
enclosed on any side or end, except that the sides may be enclosed when the ramada
roof is continuous with the roof of a cabana constructed on the sides of the
mobilehome. All local and state rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, Title
25, must be complied with.

M. Awning Enclosures: Awning enclosures may be placed on certain Spaces only and will
be approved on a case-by-case basis, in the sole discretion of management. All
applicable permits must be obtained in advance. Homeowner must obtain prior written
approval from management prior to commencing construction of any awning
enclosure. Awning enclosures shall be manufactured, engineered units that are
aesthetically compatible with the appearance of the mobilehome and are constructed of
aluminum and professionally installed with valid building permits. A minimum of fifty
percent (50%) of the wall area of the enclosure shall be "open" and may be screened or
enclosed with glass or "glassine"-type plastic windows. All awning enclosures shall
comply with Title 25. The construction requirements for room/awning enclosures are
contained in the California Building Code, Chapter 31, Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations, as that chapter may be revised from time to time.

N. Utility Connections: Homeowner's connections to Creekside's utility distribution
system are the responsibility of Homeowner's licensed contractor.

O. Electrical Service: The electrical service pedestals in Creekside are equipped for
standard 60-cycle, 50 ampere, 120/240-volt service. Homeowner warrants that his or
her mobilehome, equipment and appliances are compatible with Creekside's electrical
system and do not exceed the foregoing rating. If Homeowner's mobilehome,
equipment and/or appliances are not compatible with Creekside's electrical system,
Homeowner agrees, at his or her expense, to perform the alterations necessary to make
them compatible. Due to the potential for overloading Creekside's electrical system,
Homeowner must obtain prior written approval from management before installing
electrically operated appliances such as central air conditioners, electric clothes dryers,
heat pumps, electric water heaters, electric ovens, and stoves, charging stations and
other electrical units. Homeowner shall not connect, disconnect, or modify any utility
located anywhere in Creekside.

Homeowner agrees not to install electrical appliances that will use energy in excess of
the engineered maximum capacity for Homeowner's mobilehome. Homeowner shall not add 
breakers to Creekside's service pedestals to increase their amperage.
Homeowner also agrees to forbear from consuming such electrical current, whether
more or less than the foregoing rating, as may cause any service disruption, in order to
protect against damage to Creekside's property and other Homeowners' property.

Homeowner releases and discharges Owner from all liability and will hold Owner
harmless from any and all injuries and damages, arising out of any incompatibility
between Homeowner's mobilehome, equipment and/or appliances and Creekside's
electrical system. Homeowner further releases and discharges Owner from all liability
and will hold Owner harmless from any and all injuries and damages, arising out of
Homeowner's use of Creekside's electrical system. This release is not intended to
release gross negligence or willful misconduct of Owner, but to release Owner from
injuries and damages to the fullest extent allowed by law.

The safe connection of Homeowner's mobilehome's utility system to Creekside's utility
distribution system is Homeowner's responsibility. Creekside retains the right to
prohibit the use of any electrical appliance which would overload or strain Creekside's
electrical system. All appliances installed must be in good operating condition and must
not generate excessive noise or vibration.

P. Air Conditioning: Connecting/installing any air conditioning unit directly to
Creekside's utility system is prohibited. All air conditioning units must
connected/installed to Homeowner's side of the utility system and must receive written
approval from management before they are connected/installed to ensure that they are
compatible with Creekside's utility system.

Air conditioning condensation water must be piped away from any structure and must
not be allowed to accumulate. No window air conditioning units or evaporative swamp
coolers are permitted. Any installation pertaining to a heating and/or cooling system
must be performed by a licensed contractor and Homeowner must obtain any permits
required for such installation. All outside electrical wiring, if any, must comply with
state codes and regulations and must be of weatherproof material.

Q. Solar: Installation of solar photovoltaic systems on the mobilehome is permitted,
subject to the following requirements: (1) all installations must be performed by a solar
company licensed by the Contractors State License Board; (2) all permits, including any
required by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, must
first be obtained; (3) all installations must comply with local and state building codes
and regulations; (4) the structural integrity of the mobilehome, including, but not
limited to, the roof joists, must conform with all local and state codes and regulations
related to load, including dead load, requirements for supporting solar panels; (5) all
installations must have interconnection approval by the local utility company; (6)
installations must not violate any interconnection agreement that Creekside has with
local utility companies; and (7) Homeowner must enter into an interconnection
agreement with Creekside, for which Creekside may charge a reasonable fee.

R. Fencing: Homeowner must obtain prior written approval from management before
erecting any fence on Homeowner's Space. All fences must be of solid board-to-board
configuration, and, if painted or stained, must match Homeowner's mobilehome. No
fence may exceed six feet (6') in height and fences are only permitted on the rear 
half of the Space, with exceptions for unique Space limitations. Fencing between Homeowner's
mobilehome and the street is permitted only on certain Spaces, will be approved on a
case-by-case basis, in the sole discretion of management, and must not exceed thirty-six
(36) inches in height. Any fence must be placed inside of Homeowner's lot line and must
not infringe on any adjacent Space or Common Area.

S. Satellite Television System: For so long as is feasible, a satellite television system will
be available to Homeowners at an additional charge. Connection to the system must be
made by park personnel or agents, and any Homeowner or Homeowner's agent who
performs unauthorized work on the system will be held responsible for any damage
thereto.

T. Satellite Dishes and Antennas: Small satellite dishes one (1) meter or less in diameter
shall be permitted. Satellite dishes in excess of one (1) meter in diameter are
prohibited. Satellite dishes shall be located on the rear quarter of the mobilehome and
shall be as unobtrusive as possible without significantly decreasing efficiency or
performance. Such location shall not extend beyond the lot line, and, unless otherwise
provided by law, shall not exceed one (1) foot above the rooftop of the mobilehome. No
reception device may be installed in such a way that it encroaches onto the Common
Areas or the Space of another Homeowner or obstructs a driver's view of any street,
driveway, sidewalk, or intersection. The satellite dish must be installed and securely
affixed in a manner that will not constitute a hazard and that complies with all
applicable codes, local and state laws and regulations and manufacturer instructions.
Any antenna that is designed to receive video programming services via broadband
radio service (wireless cable), or to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals other than
via satellite, must be one (1) meter or less in diameter.

Antennas used for AM/FM radio, HAM radio, CB radio, digital audio radio services, or
antennas used as part of a hub to relay signals among multiple locations, are prohibited.
Homeowner shall be responsible for all costs associated with any reception device that
he or she installs, including, but not limited to, all costs to (i) repair, maintain, relocate
and remove any such reception device; (ii) repair damage to other property caused by
the installation, maintenance or use, or any person injured by the installation,
maintenance or use, of any such reception device, (iii) pay medical expenses incurred
by the installation, maintenance or use of any such reception device; and (iv) reimburse
and hold Owner harmless for all damage caused by the installation, maintenance and
use of any such reception device.

Due to aesthetic considerations, indoor antennas and/or cable distribution are
preferred for receiving over the air broadcast signals. The laws applicable to satellite
dishes and outside antennas are subject to change. Therefore, Homeowner is advised
that changes in the law, court decisions and rulings by the FCC may affect his or her
rights and obligations regarding the installation of satellite dishes and outside antennas
in the future.

U. Spas, Hot Tubs and Pools: Installation of any spa, hot tub, pool, or accessory structure
requires prior written approval from management and submission of the
manufacturer's specifications for electrical or utility requirements. Spas, hot tubs, and
pools requiring anything other than connection to a 110-volt outlet on the mobilehome are 
not permitted. Building permits are required with the utility connections completed
by a licensed electrical contractor. Spas, hot tubs, and pools must be located in an
inconspicuous area not visible from Creekside's streets, subject to approval by
management, and shall be covered and locked when not occupied. Strict Health
Department water quality standards shall be followed at all times.

V. Structure Limitations: Only manufactured accessory structures and equipment
installed by licensed contractors are permitted. No "homemade" structure or
equipment is permitted. This includes, but is not limited to, storage cabinets, room
additions and the like. For the safety of Homeowner and Creekside, Creekside retains
the right to impose additional requirements on Spaces in unique locations, such as
hillsides or terraced or corner Spaces.

W. Earthquake Systems: Creekside strongly suggests that a California-approved
earthquake bracing/tie down system be installed under Homeowner's mobilehome. If
Homeowner installs a mobilehome with an earthquake bracing system, such system
must be installed in compliance with the Health and Safety Code and Title 25, and any
required permit must be obtained in advance.

X. Water Softeners: Water softeners that discharge salt-water brine into Creekside's
sewer system are not permitted. Whole house water filters/conditioners are permitted
so long as they do not require a modification to Creekside's utility pedestal. In the latter
case, approval from management, in advance and in writing, and a permit, are required
before installation.

Y. Damage to Common Areas Caused by Homeowner: Any damage to Common Areas,
or the property of others, caused by Homeowner shall be Homeowner's financial
responsibility.

Z. Digging or Driving Rods/Stakes: Due to the presence of underground utilities,
Homeowner is required to receive prior written approval from management before
digging or driving rods or stakes into the ground.

AA. Accessory Equipment and Appliances: Prior to commencing installation or
changing exterior accessory equipment, or installation or changing any appliance
connected or to be connected to the electric, gas or water supply, Homeowner shall
submit for Creekside's approval a written plan describing in detail the accessory
equipment or appliance which Homeowner proposes to install or change.
Any accessory equipment or appliance installed or changed which does not conform to
Creekside's standards shall be removed by Homeowner upon receipt of written notice
from Creekside.

If Homeowner changes existing accessory equipment or an appliance, the standards for
incoming mobilehomes must be met, and all work shall be completed within sixty (60)
days of approval. Homeowner is cautioned that there are mobilehomes and Spaces in
Creekside which contain accessory equipment and appliances which no longer conform
to current park standards. Therefore, Homeowner may not assume that his or her plans
will be approved because they conform to accessory equipment or appliances existing
in or on other mobilehomes or Spaces.
Owner may, in its sole discretion, publish new park standards for, without limitation,

awnings, steps, porches, landscaping and other accessories at any time that it, in its sole
discretion, determines would be in the best interest of Creekside and Homeowner. It is
Homeowner's responsibility to verify that Homeowner's contractors are licensed,
insured, and bonded, and Creekside has no liability if such persons are not licensed or
adequately insured or bonded. Homeowner shall not suffer or permit to be enforced
against Owner's title to Creekside, or any part thereof, any lien, claim or demand arising
out of any work of construction, repair, restoration or maintenance of the Space or
Homeowner's mobilehome. Should any such lien, claim or demand be filed,
Homeowner shall cause it to be immediately removed.

It is not the responsibility of Creekside to inspect or warrant the condition or quality of
any work (including, but not limited to, the installation or repair of Homeowner's
mobilehome, driveway, walkways, fences or any other accessory structure or
equipment) performed by Homeowner or Homeowner's contractors, agents, or
employees.

Permits: Building permits, licenses, and similar permission from governmental or
quasi-governmental bodies or agencies are required and must be obtained before
construction or installation of certain accessory structures and equipment, and all such
structures and equipment must comply with all local, state, and federal ordinances and
laws.

AC. Contractors Performing Work: Only licensed contractors may spray paint in
Creekside or install items required to be connected to the electric, gas or water supply.
Each contractor performing work in Creekside must be registered with management
and must be licensed and adequately insured. It is Homeowner's responsibility to
ensure that anyone performing work at his or her Space has proper authorization from
management prior to soliciting a bid or commencing work. Creekside assumes no
liability, express or implied, for the quality of work performed by contractors hired by
Homeowner or for any damages sustained as a result thereof. All work, improvements
and repairs that require a permit must be performed by a licensed contractor or by an
owner-builder qualified as such under California law. Only licensed contractors having
adequate insurance, and, if applicable, workers compensation insurance, are permitted
to work in Creekside. Creekside may require contractors to provide proof of licensure
and insurance in advance of performing any work. 

AD. Liens and Claims: Homeowner shall not allow any lien, e.g., mechanic's lien,
materials lien, lis pendens, etc., claim, demand or other claim arising out of any work of
construction, repair, restoration, maintenance, or removal performed on or regarding
the mobilehome or Space, to be enforced against Owner and/or recorded against
Creekside property, and Homeowner will pay all liens, claims and demands before any
