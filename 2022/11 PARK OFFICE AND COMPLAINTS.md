# 11. PARK OFFICE AND COMPLAINTS
A. Business Hours: Management's business hours are posted at the Creekside office.
For life-threatening emergencies, call 911. For property-endangering emergencies
after business hours, contact management by telephone. Homeowner shall not
contact management at their private residence at any time for any park matter.

B. Complaints: All Homeowner complaints must be submitted to management in
legible handwritten or typed format during business hours. Homeowner complaints
regarding other Homeowners, Additional Occupants or guests, Park Facilities
and/or management must include details such as the nature of the problem, the
date, time and place it occurred or was observed, and the names of the persons
involved, if known. All complaints must be signed and dated by the complaining
Homeowner and delivered to management, and they will be retained in Creekside
files. Any Homeowner who observes a defect or other issue with any Park Facility,
or any other part of Creekside, must submit a complaint to management regarding
the defect or issue promptly upon observing it.

Homeowners should be aware that it is their responsibility to settle among
themselves such issues as would normally arise in any neighborhood. If another
Homeowner, Additional Occupant, or guest is disturbing you, it is agreed that you
will affirmatively contact the person and make a reasonable effort to remedy the
disturbance. Owner shall have no responsibility, duty, or obligation to intercede in a
"neighbor vs. neighbor" dispute, except as required by law. If the disturbance is of a
a criminal nature, then you should immediately contact the appropriate law
enforcement agency and then contact management and fill out a complaint form. To
report an in-progress, life-threatening emergency, call 911. Management will not
no interfere in or attempt to settle disputes of this nature. Should a dispute become
algpark-related rather than neighbor-related, Homeowner agrees that any complaint
submitted may, if necessary, be used in court and that Homeowner may be required
to appear in court to testify.
