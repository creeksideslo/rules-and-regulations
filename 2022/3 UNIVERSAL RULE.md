# 3. UNIVERSAL RULE
The universal rule is always applicable and controlling unless a more specific rule
exists, in that Homeowners must conduct themselves in a reasonable manner and be
respectful of the legitimate rights of others, so as to avoid (1) adversely affecting such
rights; (2) creating a nuisance, breach of quiet enjoyment or annoyance; (3)
unreasonably endangering others and/or their rights; and (4) trespassing, entering,
invading or touching the property of other Homeowners, management or persons.
