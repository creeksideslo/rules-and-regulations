# 34. RESPONSIBILITY, LIABILITY AND REMEDIES
A. No Waiver of Default: Unless otherwise provided by the Mobilehome Residency
Law, Owner shall notify Homeowner of any violation of these Rules by either hand
delivering the notice to Homeowner or placing the notice in the United States mail.
The failure by Owner to provide such notice shall not constitute a waiver of any of
the rights and remedies afforded to Owner by applicable law or these Rules. Owner
shall have the right at any time once a violation of these Rules occurs to provide
such notice. Homeowner shall not rely upon Owner's failure to provide such notice
in taking any action or refraining from taking any action.

B. Remedies: Owner's remedies in the event of a violation of these Rules shall include,
but not be limited to, (1) terminating Homeowner's tenancy pursuant to Civil Code
Section 798.56; and (2) obtaining an injunction enjoining the violation pursuant to
Civil Code Section 798.88.

C. Hold Harmless: Except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
Owner, Owner is not responsible for any loss of any nature suffered by Homeowner
or his/her Additional Occupants or guests. Homeowner shall hold Owner
harmless from any loss or liability arising out of or in connection with Homeowner's
use of his or her mobilehome, Space or improvements, damage to others' property,
or while using Creekside property, including any loss in connection with motor
homes, travel trailers, boats or other property owned by Homeowner. Owner is not
responsible and will be held harmless in connection with works of improvement on
the Space or mobilehome by Homeowner, his or her agents or contractors, and any
parties to such works of improvement. The failure of Owner to record or post a
notice of non-responsibility shall not affect Owner's non-responsibility for such
works of improvement.
