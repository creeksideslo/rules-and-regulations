# 5. COMPLIANCE WITH LEASE AGREEMENT AND RULES AND REGULATIONS
A. Compliance with Lease Agreement: Homeowner shall, at all times, have a current
written Lease Agreement with Creekside pursuant to Civil Code Sections 798.15 and
798.75, and shall not violate any term, condition, or provision of the Lease
Agreement applicable to Homeowner's tenancy in Creekside.

B. Compliance with Rules and Regulations: Homeowner shall ensure that
Homeowner and Homeowner's Additional Occupants and guests comply with these
Rules.

The promises, duties and conditions of these Rules are a private matter of contract
between Homeowner and management. These Rules are not for the benefit of any
other Homeowner, Additional Occupant, guest, or person. It is agreed that no other
Homeowner's Lease Agreement or Rules benefits you and that these Rules do not
benefit others; there is no third-party beneficiary to this document. Thus, no claim
against management may be made for any decision or policy to refrain from
enforcement of these Rules, including covenants to maintain peace and quiet, bars
against encroachment, or any disagreement with another Homeowner or other
person residing in or upon a Space in Creekside, for any reason, including advice of
counsel. Thus, in the event, for example, that Homeowner complains that another
Homeowner is violating one of these Rules, such violation, if any, only gives rise to a
remedy that is available to management, and such violation, if any, does not give rise
to a claim by the complaining Homeowner against management for not enforcing
these Rules. This provision is the essence of these Rules, and it is not subject to any
waiver by management unless expressed in writing and executed by Owner.
Management has no authority to waive this provision.

Any violation of these Rules shall be deemed a public nuisance. Homeowner agrees
that any such violation cannot reasonably or adequately be compensated with
damages in an action at law, and Owner shall therefore be entitled to injunctive
relief, including, but not limited to, restraining Homeowner from continuing to
violate these Rules, or from allowing a condition which violates these Rules to exist
or continue to exist.

Homeowners and their accompanied Additional Occupants and guests have a right
to use Park Facilities only if they comply with these Rules and Creekside's other
residency documents.
