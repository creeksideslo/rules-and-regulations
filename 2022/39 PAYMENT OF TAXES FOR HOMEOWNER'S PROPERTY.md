# 39. PAYMENT OF TAXES FOR HOMEOWNER'S PROPERTY
Homeowner shall pay, before delinquency, all taxes, assessments, license fees,
registration fees and annual taxes, use taxes and other charges ("taxes") that are levied
or assessed against Homeowner's mobilehome and personal property, and the
improvements installed or located in or on the Space, the mobilehome and the
accessory structures and equipment ("improvements"). Upon Owner's request,
Homeowner will furnish satisfactory evidence of these payments. If the assessed value
of Creekside, the Space and/or other improvements is increased by the inclusion of a
value placed on Homeowner's improvements and Creekside pays the taxes on such
improvements, or the taxes based on the increased assessed value of such
improvements, Homeowner will, upon written notice from Owner, reimburse Creekside
for the taxes so levied, or the proportion of the taxes resulting from the increased
assessed value, ten (10) days after service of such written notice. Creekside will have
the right to pay these taxes regardless of the validity of the levy or assessment.
Homeowner may contest such tax that is levied or assessed against Homeowner's
personal property and improvements. However, Homeowner remains obligated to pay
such tax before delinquency.
