# 26. LOT LINES AND EASEMENTS
The lot lines at the perimeter of the Space were for purposes of compliance with legal
requirements for construction and operation. The area leased by Homeowner includes
the footprint of the mobilehome and accessory structures and required setbacks from
the mobilehome and accessory structures; the area expected to be used and enjoyed
may not be represented by apparent physical boundaries or lot lines of the Space as
they exist at the inception of tenancy, as such lines may be changed, enlarged, or
reduced as legal requirements, compliance or other business necessities may require.

The designated lot lines are required by law and do not represent a warranted area for
use and enjoyment, are subject to change and may be modified as allowed by law.
Homeowner shall approve and allow a modification in lot line locations if such
modification does not exceed thirty-six inches (36") in length or width of the Space.

Any modification shall not result in reduction or offset of rents. In such cases, no claim
shall lie against management for lot line modifications or satisfaction of legal
requirements, compliance, or other business necessities. Homeowner is responsible
for Space maintenance within the area defined by the lot line markers and may use,
occupy, and enjoy such area subject to modification as provided above. Homeowner
shall maintain his or her lot line markers as they currently exist and Homeowner shall
promptly notify Creekside if Homeowner's lot line markers are lost, moved, or
destroyed. Homeowner shall indemnify and hold Owner harmless against any loss,
cost, damage, expense (including attorneys' fees), or other liability incurred or
imposed by reason of any person, association, firm, or corporation claiming to have an
interest in the Space in the event that Homeowner's lot line markers are lost, moved,
or destroyed. The foregoing defines the enforceable expectations of use, occupation
and enjoyment to which Homeowner is entitled.

The lot lines originally established at the time Creekside was built will be the lot lines
used for all purposes regarding the present and future installation of mobilehomes
and other accessory structures, equipment, and improvements to the Space. The only
exception will be where the originally established lot lines were subsequently
modified by Owner or someone else who owned Creekside with the intention of
deliberately altering such lot lines, and, in those cases, the subsequently modified lot
lines will remain in effect. Management reserves the right to modify any lot line at any
time provided that such modification does not violate any applicable law. If
Homeowner or any prior Homeowner of the Space or any adjoining Space has
installed landscaping or other improvements that encroach across any lot line and by 
those actions has established, over an extended period of time (in management's
opinion), that the area encroached on belonged to and is allowed to be used by that
Homeowner, then the Homeowner of any adjoining Space will be permitted to
continue to use the area encroached upon. This use of the encroached-upon area will
not, however, affect the location of the lot line markers.

The Space is subject to all easements and encumbrances that are of record and that
exist in fact. The Space may contain underground easements, rights of way, utilities or
other encumbrances which may limit the maximum size of any mobilehome, accessory
structure and/or equipment which may be subsequently installed on the Space, and
which would otherwise be permitted by defined lot lines and applicable codes and
standards. No easement of any kind may be acquired in any area beyond the Space, and
no encroachment is permitted to ripen into any form of equitable servitude, easement,
or possessory right of any kind.
