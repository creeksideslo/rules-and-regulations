21. DRAINAGE. Drainage on and from the space shall be the responsibility of resident. Precautions should be taken to ensure proper drainage of all roofs, yards and landscape areas. Downspouts and gutters should be designed to carry water to the nearest street. Residents should avoid letting water drain under their mobilehomes.
   1. Curb ramps may be installed by residents, provided that they rest on the concrete gutter and not on the asphalt. Residents are responsible for keeping ramps free of debris so they do not interfere with drainage in the gutters.
   2. Washing of streets and driveways is not permitted because of the damage water does to asphalt. Car washing is permitted ONLY in the designated car wash area. Residents may wash their mobilehomes, but they are urged to practice water conservation at all times.
