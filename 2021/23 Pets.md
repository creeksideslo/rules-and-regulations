23. PETS. Each household may have two (2) pets (dogs and/or cats) in the mobilehome or on the space, if a Pet Agreement is on file with management. The Pet Agreement is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Resident agrees to comply with the Pet Agreement and further agrees to remove his or her pets from Creekside if the Pet Agreement is not complied with. All pets shall be kept reasonably quiet, and resident is responsible for ensuring that his or her pets do not disturb other residents. Dogs shall be on leashes on Creekside streets and in Creekside common areas, except in the creek area where they may be off leash if properly supervised. Residents must clean up after their pets at all times. Residents may not leave food out at night for cats or other animals, because doing so attracts other cats and raccoons.
