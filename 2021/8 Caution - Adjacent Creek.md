8. CAUTION - ADJACENT CREEK.  The creek bank is continuously altered by the water in the creek and is potentially dangerous, particularly during the rainy season. It is therefore wise to avoid the creek bank at all times. The paths in the creek area are made of natural materials (not paved), and tree roots may create uneven areas and trip hazards. Caution is urged when walking in the creek area, especially for persons who are unsteady on their feet.
