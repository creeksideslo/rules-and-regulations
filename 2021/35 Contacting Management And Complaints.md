   1. Except in an emergency, all complaints must be in writing and signed by the person making the complaint. Complaints may be delivered to the office in person, faxed or mailed to the office, oreÂ­ mailed to an e-mail address to be provided by management.
   2. Complaints must be submitted on a complaint form, or must include (1) the printed name and signature of the person making the complaint, (2) the date of the incident or situation, (3) the person(s) involved in the incident or situation, and (4) a description of the incident or situation.
   3. Creekside cannot take legal action to remedy the incident or situation complained about if it does not have written complaints on which to base the legal action. The name(s) of the complaining resident(s) will be kept confidential unless and until the situation or incident is turned over to the court.
   4. If any resident would like to send a complaint to the owner of Creekside as opposed to management, he or she may send it to a street address or e-mail address to be provided by management.
