18. SATELLITE TELEVISION SYSTEM AND ANTENNAS. A satellite television system is available to all Creekside residents at an additional charge. Connection to the system must be made by Creekside employees or agents, and any resident or agent who performs unauthorized work on the system will be held responsible for any damage thereto. Because the system provides local stations and satellite programming, television antennas, except satellite dishes or antennas less than one (1) meter in diameter, are not permitted. Satellite dishes must be installed at the rear of the mobilehome in keeping with the manufacturer's specifications, positioned for minimum visibility, and must not damage any property belonging to Creekside.
